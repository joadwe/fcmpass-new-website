1. 'Create Set' button takes the current edit field inputs for rainbow particles and creates a set. Note: 'Number of Populations' must be a whole number.
2. 'Delete Set' button deletes the currently selected rainbow bead entry from the table. Note: This will delete any associated cross calibrations which will not be recoverable.
3. 'Append Set' button appends the current edit field inputs for rainbow particles to the currently selected rainbow bead entry from the table. Note: If the 'Number of Populations' is changed, all cross calibrations must be deleted as they are no longer consistent with the rainbow particles.
4. 'Cross Calibration Display Options' are filters to be applied to the cross calibration table on the right-hand side.
5. 'Add Fluorophore' button requires a rainbow bead entry to be selected from the rainbow bead table on the left-hand side. This will open up the 'Cross Calibration GUI' and allow for registering a cross calibration to the selected rainbow bead entry.
6. 'Delete Fluorophore' button deletes the currently selected cross calibration from the cross calibration table.
7. 'Append Fluorophore' button opens up the 'Cross Calibration GUI' and will overwrite the selected cross calibration bead entry
