# Cataloguing

The catalogue is the backbone of the FCMPASS software and allows you as a user not to have remember the fine details of your reference materials when it comes to optimizing your flow cytometer or calibrating an experiemnt and generating a traceable, transparent MIFlowCyt and MIFlowCyt-EV report.&#x20;

The catalogue is used to store information about flow cytometers, light scatter reference material, fluorescent reference material, and rainbow beads with the aim to reduce inputting repetitive information and being able to directly write detailed meta-data to output reports for sharing data. The catalogue can be opened from the main start menu by clicking the "Catalogue" button.

Upon loading the catalogue, five tabs are available: Cytometers, Light Scatter, Fluorescence, Rainbow Particles, and MIFlowCyt.
